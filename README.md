# Prak  involves applying and investigating various supervised learning algorithms like Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), along with unsupervised learning methods such as K-Means for clustering and Naive Bayes for classification. Furthermore, it delves into market basket analysis, a technique for discovering patterns in transaction data, and incorporates data visualization through the use of matplotlib.pyplot.
